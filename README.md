# SMS/IM Spam Filtering System

## Overview

The SMS/IM Spam Filtering System is a web-based application designed to detect and filter out spam messages from incoming SMS or instant messaging (IM) content. Built using Flask, this application leverages a machine learning-based approach to classify messages as either "spam" or "not spam."

## Objectives

- **User Interface:** Provide an intuitive web interface for users to input and analyze messages.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporate a pre-trained model for accurate spam classification.
- **Backend System:** Implement a robust backend with MySQL database integration for data storage and analysis.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing and deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines.
- **Monitoring:** Ensure application reliability and performance with a monitoring system.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SrushtiGup26/TestingProject.git
    cd TestingProject
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure the Database:**

   Set up your MySQL database and update the database configuration in `config.py`.

4. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and includes:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests on each push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Deploys the application to Heroku after successful tests.

## Testing

The application includes automated tests for critical functionality. Tests are executed as part of the CI pipeline using `unittest`. To run tests locally:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed to Heroku. The deployment is automated via the CI/CD pipeline and is triggered by successful tests. For manual deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Add Heroku Remote:**

    ```bash
    git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-heroku-app-name.git
    ```

2. **Push to Heroku:**

    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

## User Interface

The UI is developed using HTML, CSS, and Flaskâ€™s templating engine. Users can input messages and receive instant feedback on whether the message is classified as spam or not.

## Database Integration

The system uses MySQL for storing historical message data and their classifications. Ensure the MySQL server is running and accessible.

## Monitoring

The application includes a monitoring system to track reliability and performance in production. Alerts and metrics are configured to notify developers of any production issues.
